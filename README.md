# Examples-of-Python-Spiders
There are three Python Spiders written by myself using PhantomJS, Selenium, and AutoIt.

phone_scrapy.py:
 Â   using PhantomJS or Chrome  to scrapy phone number information using Baidu.
    
baidu_image_spider.py:
    using Selenium to download images automatically from Baidu Image webpage.
   
auto_upload_file.py:
    using Selenium and AutoIt to upload your computer's file into Baidu Cloud Disk. To run the programming, you need to adjust the coordinate of positions in upload_file.au3 using AutoIt Window Info. Then compile upload_file.au3, which generates upload_file.exe file. Put the upload_file.exe in right position in order to let Python execuate it.
    
Hope these three spiders by simple examples can help you!
